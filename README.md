# Upscaler

**Upscaler** is a lightweight command-line tool designed for high-quality image and video upscaling.  
The project provides a clean Python interface around multiple backends, including traditional scaling methods and external AI-based engines.

This repository is part of a broader toolchain and is intended to be reused across different applications.

## Features (Work in Progress)

- Simple CLI for images and videos  
- Modular backend system  
- Support for external upscaling binaries  
- Automatic resource management and model handling  
- Clean Python API for integrating upscaling into larger projects  

## Status 
This project is under active development. 
Interfaces, backends and behavior may change.
